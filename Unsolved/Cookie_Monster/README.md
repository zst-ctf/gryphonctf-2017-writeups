## Challenge 
> Cookie monster has stolen my cookies again! And apparently, he learnt how to create a website to get more cookies! He is accepting nice images from users and running it on his image viewer using what he thinks is the best browser, Internet Explorer. Retrieve the cookie that he stole from me! Thanks!
